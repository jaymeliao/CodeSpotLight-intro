# Project Title:

CodeSpotlight

## Overview

CodeSpotlightSpotlight is a social media platform designed specifically for developers to showcase their coding projects. Users can post short descriptions along with images or videos to highlight their work. The platform allows for engagement through comments, creating a community of developers sharing and appreciating each other's projects.

### Problem

Many developers lack a dedicated platform to showcase their projects in a concise and visually appealing manner. Existing social media platforms may not cater specifically to the developer community, making it challenging for them to gain recognition and feedback on their work.

### User Profile

CodeSpotlight caters to a user base consisting mainly of developers and tech enthusiasts. Users will create profiles, share project updates, and engage with others' projects. Special considerations include ensuring a seamless user experience for viewing and interacting with coding projects.

### Features

- **User Profiles:** Users can create and customize profiles to showcase their skills and projects.
- **Project Posts:** Users can create posts with short descriptions, images, or videos to showcase their coding projects.
- **Comments:** A commenting system allows users to provide feedback and engage with each other's projects.
- **User Interactions:** Features like likes and shares to enhance project visibility.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios
- **Backend:** Express, Knex for database interactions, Bcrypt for password hashing
- **Database:** MySQL

### APIs

No external APIs will be used initially. Spotling will primarily rely on its database for storing user and project information.

### Sitemap

- Home Feed
- User Profile
- Project Details Page
- Comment Section

### Mockups

[I will try to creat my Ui/UX  using tools like Figma.]

### Data

The database will store user profiles, project posts, comments, and interactions between users and projects.

### Endpoints

- `/api/users` (GET, POST)
- `/api/projects` (GET, POST)
- `/api/comments` (GET, POST)

### Auth

Authentication will be implemented using JWT tokens for user login and session management.

## Roadmap

### Week 1:

- Set up the project structure with React and Express.
- Implement user authentication and profile creation.
- Create a basic frontend for viewing the home feed and user profiles.

### Week 2:

- Enable users to create and display project posts.
- Implement the commenting system.
- Enhance user interactions (likes, shares).

### Week 3:

- Polish the user interface for better user experience.
- Test the application for any bugs or issues.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform.

## Nice-to-haves

- Implement a search functionality for discovering specific projects.
- Integrate notifications for user interactions.
- Explore additional features based on user feedback.
